# ALPHA-7 Welcome Robot

## Introduction

Alpha-7 is a friendly robot designed to welcome visitors at exhibitions. It's made specifically for this purpose, using face detection to greet people as they arrive. It has three main jobs: saying hello, guessing how old people are, and figuring out if they're men or women based on their faces. It uses special models called "age-net.caffemodel" and "gender-net.caffemodel" to do these tasks. What's cool is that Alpha-7 talks in a male voice to women and a female voice to men, making the welcome feel more personal. It's all about making guests feel at home when they visit the exhibition.
